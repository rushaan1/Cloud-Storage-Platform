whenever user clicks on any folder from a predefinedFilter, that query param should be removed and should be treated as accessing any other normal folder

Pre-defined Filter routes:
.com/preDefinedFilter/home
.com/preDefinedFilter/recents
.com/preDefinedFilter/favorites
.com/preDefinedFilter/trash

All type-based pre-defined filter should apply only to currently opened folder and should be independent of currently opened folder and its depth

Pre-defined Type Filter routes (examples):
.com/folder/sampleFolderName
.com/folder/sampleFolderName/sampleFolderName?predefinedTypeFilter=images
.com/folder/sampleFolderName?predefinedTypeFilter=audio
.com/preDefinedFilter/home?predefinedTypeFilter=images
and so on...

If sortingOrder query param is not presenting the order should default to ASCENDING but if sortBy is not present but sortingOrder is then no sorting should be applied

Sorting (examples):
.com/folder/sampleFolderName?sortBy=ALPHABETICAL?sortingOrder=ASCENDING
.com/folder/sampleFolderName/sampleFolderName?sortBy=DATEADDED?sortingOrder=DESCENDING
.com/folder/sampleFolderName?sortBy=SIZE

Filtering (examples):
.com/searchFilter?q=random+search+string
.com/searchFilter?q=random+search+string?sortBy=ALPHABETICAL?predefinedTypeFilter=images
