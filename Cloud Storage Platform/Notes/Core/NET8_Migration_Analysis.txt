.NET 8 Migration Analysis - Potential Breaking Changes

CURRENT STATE:
- Target Framework: net6.0 across all projects
- ASP.NET Core 6.0.35 packages
- Entity Framework Core 6.0.35
- JWT Bearer 6.0.35

CRITICAL BREAKING CHANGES:

1. ALLOWSYNCHRONOUSIO DEPRECATION (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Current: opts.AllowSynchronousIO = true in Program.cs
   - Issue: Deprecated in .NET 7, removed in .NET 8
   - Impact: File streaming operations in RentedStreamResult.cs and file previews
   - Solution: Replace synchronous operations with async alternatives
   - Files affected: RentedStreamResult.cs, FileRetrievalService.cs, ThumbnailService.cs

2. MICROSOFT.VISUALBASIC DEPENDENCY (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: Microsoft.VisualBasic 10.3.0 in Core project
   - Usage: Only using Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO namespace (imported but not used)
   - Impact: Minimal - appears to be unused dependency
   - Solution: Remove the package reference entirely
   - Files affected: CloudStoragePlatform.Core.csproj

3. PACKAGE VERSION COMPATIBILITY (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Current packages need major version updates:
     * Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer: 6.0.35 → 8.0.x
     * Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore: 6.0.35 → 8.0.x
     * Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.*: 6.0.35 → 8.0.x
     * Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration: 6.0.2 → 8.0.x
   - Impact: Potential breaking changes in Identity, EF Core APIs
   - Solution: Update all packages to .NET 8 compatible versions

4. SIXLABORS.IMAGESHARP COMPATIBILITY (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: SixLabors.ImageSharp 3.1.7
   - Usage: ThumbnailService.cs for image processing
   - Impact: API changes between versions
   - Solution: Update to latest .NET 8 compatible version
   - Files affected: ThumbnailService.cs

5. PDFIUMVIEWER COMPATIBILITY (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Current: PdfiumViewer 2.13.0
   - Usage: Not directly used in code (likely for PDF preview functionality)
   - Impact: May need updates for .NET 8 compatibility
   - Solution: Check for .NET 8 compatible version or alternatives

6. JSON SERIALIZATION CHANGES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: System.Text.Json usage in SSE.cs
   - Impact: .NET 8 may have different default behaviors
   - Solution: Review JsonSerializerOptions and ensure compatibility
   - Files affected: SSE.cs

7. IDENTITY FRAMEWORK CHANGES (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Current: ASP.NET Core Identity with custom ApplicationUser/ApplicationRole
   - Impact: Potential breaking changes in Identity APIs
   - Areas to review:
     * UserManager/SignInManager usage in AccountController
     * Custom user/role entities
     * Password validation rules
   - Files affected: AccountController.cs, ApplicationUser.cs, ApplicationRole.cs

8. ENTITY FRAMEWORK CORE CHANGES (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Current: EF Core 6 with lazy loading proxies
   - Impact: Potential breaking changes in:
     * Lazy loading behavior
     * Query translation
     * Migration generation
   - Areas to review:
     * Repository patterns
     * Navigation properties
     * Query optimizations
   - Files affected: All repository classes, DbContext

9. JWT BEARER AUTHENTICATION CHANGES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: JWT Bearer with custom cookie reading
   - Impact: Potential changes in token validation behavior
   - Areas to review:
     * TokenValidationParameters
     * Cookie handling
     * Claims processing
   - Files affected: Program.cs, JwtService.cs, AccountController.cs

10. HTTP PIPELINE CHANGES (LOW PRIORITY)
    - Current: Custom middleware for SSE and protocol handling
    - Impact: Potential changes in middleware behavior
    - Files affected: Program.cs (SSE middleware)

11. CONFIGURATION SYSTEM CHANGES (LOW PRIORITY)
    - Current: IConfiguration usage throughout
    - Impact: Minimal - mostly compatible
    - Areas to review: Configuration binding and validation

12. CORS POLICY CHANGES (LOW PRIORITY)
    - Current: Custom CORS policy for Angular localhost
    - Impact: Minimal - should remain compatible
    - Files affected: Program.cs

MIGRATION STEPS RECOMMENDATION:

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   - Remove Microsoft.VisualBasic dependency
   - Update all NuGet packages to .NET 8 versions
   - Test Identity framework compatibility

2. CRITICAL FIXES:
   - Replace AllowSynchronousIO usage with async alternatives
   - Update SixLabors.ImageSharp to compatible version
   - Review and test EF Core queries

3. TESTING PRIORITIES:
   - File upload/download functionality
   - Authentication/authorization flows
   - Database operations and migrations
   - Image thumbnail generation
   - SSE (Server-Sent Events) functionality

4. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - .NET 8 has improved performance but may expose existing bottlenecks
   - Review async/await patterns throughout the codebase
   - Consider using new .NET 8 features for optimization

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- HIGH RISK: AllowSynchronousIO removal, package compatibility
- MEDIUM RISK: Identity/EF Core API changes, ImageSharp updates
- LOW RISK: Configuration, CORS, middleware changes

ESTIMATED MIGRATION EFFORT: 2-3 days for critical fixes, 1 week for comprehensive testing
