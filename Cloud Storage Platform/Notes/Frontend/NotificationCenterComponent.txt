NotificationCenterComponent (Angular):

Purpose
 - Central hub for transient/sticky notifications, selection/move panels, and upload progress
 - Coordinates UI alerts across app via EventService and FilesStateService

Initialization & Layout
 - Standalone component; collects panel refs (upload, selection, delete-confirm, move)
 - Keeps ordered list of panels to manage stacking and sticky behavior
 - Restores upload progress from localStorage on init

Sticky/Alert Behavior
 - Tracks mostRecentNonStickyNotification; makes it sticky and shows "+N notifications" alert when scrolled
 - Updates sticky timestamps to current HH:MM on activation
 - Dismiss logic cascades to previous alerts in LIFO order

Event Wiring
 - Subscribes to FilesState.selectedItems$: toggles selection info panel visibility and count
 - Subscribes to FilesState.itemsBeingMoved$: shows/hides move panel and counts items
 - Listens to EventService:
   - "deleteConfirmNotif": shows confirm panel with message and callback
   - "addNotif": creates ephemeral text notification (deduplicates identical active text), auto-dismiss after timeout
   - "uploadProgress": updates progress bar and text; when -1, finalizes and emits completion notif (uses localStorage counters and target path)

Scrolling/Sticky Positioning
 - Computes sticky top offsets dynamically using heights of .top-panel and .breadcrumbs; adjusts for non-viewer contexts
 - Recomputes on view checks and window scroll

Bulk Actions
 - moveToTrash/restore/delete: splits selected files/folders; calls batch APIs; emits success toasts; clears selection
 - activateMoveState: sets selected items to move, navigates to home if needed, or reloads
 - move: resolves destination from breadcrumbs (only home allowed from filter routes), batches move for files/folders, emits success toast
 - download: composes download URL for mixed selection and opens new tab; then clears selection

Helpers
 - getScrollableParent: finds nearest scrollable ancestor for alert logic
 - createNotificationDiv: builds DOM for alert with close icon and scroll-to-top link
 - setLatestAlertNotification/dismiss* manage sticky queue and DOM cleanup
